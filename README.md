# tetris holdem

What it sounds like pretty much

## Development Setup

Requirements:
- Godot 3.2
- CMake
- SConstruct for gdnative build

Setup:

`git clone --recurse-submodules -j8 https://github.com/harryjjacobs/tetris-holdem.git`

`cd gdnative`

Run `./build.sh` (or `build.bat` for windows) 

There is currently no gdnative build for windows. TODO: a build.bat similar to build.sh in gdnative directory needs to be created
for windows platform support.
